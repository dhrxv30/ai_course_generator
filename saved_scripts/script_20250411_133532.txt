**Host:** So, what exactly does Amigo do? It takes complex academic stuff and simplifies it into visual formats that are super easy to understand. Imagine taking a dense research paper and turning it into a clear flowchart, or a captivating video lesson!

**(Host:** How does it work? Well, Amigo uses the power of AI to automatically pull out the important bits from your study materials. Think of it as AI-powered highlighting and summarizing, all done for you in a snap! This solves the biggest problems in learning: it's not scalable or easy to create good study materials. With Amigo, educators can make more content in less time!

**(Host:** Amigo acts like your personal, intelligent study assistant. It can grab text from PDFs, give you AI-powered summaries, and even create cool visual flowcharts using something called Mermaid.js. But it doesn’t stop there! It can even turn those PDFs into personalized video courses, making learning way more interactive and fun. We even plan to add quizzes and flashcards to reinforce what you’ve learned!

**Host:** Now, for the techy stuff – but don't worry, we'll keep it simple! Amigo uses a bunch of cool technologies to make all this magic happen. We use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the user interface interactive. On the backend, Python with Flask handles all the server logic. And to make things super smart, we've integrated Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash AI using Google Generative AI API for content processing.

**(Transition to a flowchart visually representing the AI Logic & Implementation Overview)**

**Host:** So how does the AI work exactly? First we're using Gemini 2.0 Flash because it integrates well with Google. Then we have an intelligent prompting system that guides the AI to generate helpful explanations. With these prompts, we can generate summaries that are easy to understand, create flowcharts, and generate video scripts.
