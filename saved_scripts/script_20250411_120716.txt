**(Intro - Upbeat music and visuals of electrical machines)**

Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel! Today, we're diving into the world of Electrical Machines -1, specifically Module 5. We're going to be looking at some essential concepts for three-phase induction motors, including starters, speed control and single phase induction motors.

**(Transition to whiteboard or screen with diagrams)**

First up: Why do we even need starters for three-phase induction motors? Well, when an AC motor starts at full voltage, it can pull a LOT of current – like, two to six times its normal running current! While the motor itself can usually handle this initial surge, for larger motors, this can cause problems. It can damage connected machinery and mess with the voltage on the power line, affecting other equipment. So, starters help reduce this starting current.

**(Focus on Stator Resistor Starting Method)**

Let's look at one way to do this: Stator Resistor Starting. Imagine you're turning down the volume on a radio. That’s kinda what we're doing here. We add a resistor (or sometimes a reactor, which is similar) to each phase of the motor circuit. This drops the voltage applied to the motor during startup, which in turn reduces the current. Think of it like using a dimmer switch on a light bulb. The starting torque, or twisting force, also decreases with the voltage drop. As the motor speeds up, we gradually cut out the resistance until it's running on full voltage. We have an expression for the starting torque in terms of full load torque for the stator resistor starting method.

**(Transition to Auto Transformer Starting Method)**

Another method is the Auto Transformer Starting Method. Here, we use an auto transformer to step down the voltage before it reaches the motor. It's like a controlled way to give the motor only a portion of the full voltage during startup. Once it’s up to speed, we disconnect the auto transformer and apply the full voltage. Like the Stator Resistance method, reducing the voltage, also reduces the starting torque. We have an expression for the starting torque in terms of full load torque for the auto transformer starting method.

**(Transition to Star-Delta Starting Method)**

Then there's the Star-Delta Starting Method. This one's a bit clever. It’s mainly used for motors designed to run with their windings connected in a "delta" configuration. During startup, we temporarily connect the windings in a "star" configuration, which reduces the voltage applied to each winding. Once the motor reaches a steady speed, we switch the connection back to "delta" for normal operation. We have an expression for the starting torque in terms of full load torque for the star delta starting method.

**(Discuss Direct On-Line Starter (DOL))**

Okay, now the Direct On-Line Starter (DOL). This is the simplest and cheapest method. It directly connects the motor to the full voltage. Because it is so simple, it has a very large starting current, 6 to 8 times the rated current. Because of this large surge, it is typically only used for motors with a rating of less than 5kW. The starter also has many safety mechanisms that helps protect the motor and the user.

**(Discuss Rotor Resistance Starting)**

Now, the Rotor Resistance Starting. This is typically used for Slip-ring (wound rotor) IM. The starting current is reduced as the resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. Though the starting current decreases, the total resistance increases, which results in an increase of starting torque. It may be observed that the starting torque increases till it reaches maximum value.

**(Discuss Soft (Electronic) Starter)**

Now, the Soft (Electronic) Starter. The system consists of two back to back SCRs for each phase. Control Logic circuitry in form of two comparators - LM324 and LM339 to produce the level and the ramp voltage and an opto -isolator to control the application of gate voltage to the each SCR in each phase.

**(Transition to Speed Control)**

Next, let's talk about speed control. Motors aren't always needed to run at full speed. There are different ways to control the speed of the I.M. The first is the Stator Voltage Control. The variation of speed torque curves with respect to the applied voltage is shown in fig. (3).These curves show t hat the slip at maximum torque S m remains same, while the value of stall torque comes down with decrease in applied voltage. The machine may not start. This method of trying to control the speed is best suited for loads that require very little starting torque, but their torque requirement may increase with speed. Another method is the Supply Frequency Control. The synchronous speed and, therefore, the speed of motor can be controlled by varying the supply frequency. To avoid saturation and to minimize losses, motor is operated at rated air gap flux by varying terminal voltage with frequency so as to maintain (v/f ) ratio constant at rated value. A final way is the Rotor Resistance Control. This method of speed control is very simple. It is possible to have a large starting torque and low starting current at small value of slip. The major disadvantage of this method is that the efficiency is low due to additional losses in resistors connected in the rotor circuit.

**(Single Phase Induction Motor)**

The next thing we're going to talk about is Single Phase Induction Motors. According to double revolving field theory, any alternating quantity can be resolved into two rotating components which rotate in opposite directions and each having magnitude as half of the maximum magnitude of the alternating quantity. At start these two torque are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Each torque tries to rotate the rotor in its own direction. Thus net torque experienced by the rotor is zero at start. And hence the single phase induction motors are not self-starting .There are several types of Single Phase Induction Motors; Split Phase Induction Motor, Capacitor Start IM and Capacitor Start Capacitor Run IM, Shaded Pole Single Phase Induction Motors.

**(Doubly fed Induction generator)**

Finally, we have Doubly fed Induction generator. Doubly fed electrical generators are similar to AC electrical generators , but have additional features which allow them to run at speeds slightly above or below their natural synchronous speed. This is useful for lar ge variable speed wind turbines , because wind speed can change suddenly.

**(Conclusion - Visuals return)**

So, that’s a quick overview of starters and speed control methods for three-phase induction motors! We covered why starters are needed, looked at stator resistor, auto transformer, star-delta starting, direct on-line starter, rotor resistance starter, soft starter, speed control, single phase induction motor, and Doubly fed Induction generator.
