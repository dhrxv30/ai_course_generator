**(Intro - Upbeat music and graphics of books transforming into cool visuals)**

Hey everyone, and welcome! Ever feel like your textbooks are speaking a different language? Or that you're spending way too much time just trying to understand the basics? Well, get ready to meet your new study buddy: Amigo!

**(Transition to explaining Amigo's purpose)**

Amigo is all about taking boring, complicated academic stuff and turning it into something awesome, something visual, and something that actually *makes sense*. Think of it as academic content, totally transformed!

**(Explain key features in a friendly tone)**

So, how does Amigo work its magic? We’re using some seriously cool AI to automatically grab all the important stuff from your study materials. We're talking about quickly extracting the key information from those dense PDFs. Imagine just uploading a document and *bam*, instant summaries, flowcharts, and even video scripts!

Why is this a big deal? Well, creating study materials the old-fashioned way takes *forever*. It's not scalable, meaning you can't easily make tons of it. Amigo solves that! It’s like having a super-smart assistant that helps you understand and remember things faster. It helps educators create more content in less time, and it helps you, the student, actually *learn* the material!

**(Dive into specifics in a simple way)**

Amigo is like a Swiss Army knife for learning!

First, it's a *smart PDF processor*. It instantly pulls out the text you need.

Second, it creates *AI-powered summaries* that are super clear and student-friendly.

Third, it generates *dynamic visualizations* using something called Mermaid.js. Don’t worry about the fancy name - think of it as making cool flowcharts to show you exactly how things connect.

And get this: it can even turn your PDFs into *personalized video courses*! Imagine watching a fun, engaging video instead of staring at a wall of text.

(Mention future plans) And that's not all! We're also working on adding quizzes and flashcards to help you really nail down the material.

**(Briefly explain how it works behind the scenes)**

Now, a little peek under the hood. Amigo uses technologies you might have heard of like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for making the website look good and work smoothly. On the backend, it's powered by Python and Flask. The real secret sauce is Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model, which helps generate summaries and even video scripts!
