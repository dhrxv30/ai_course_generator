First, let's cover the basics. This is for the Universal Human Values course, with the code 22UH48. The assignment was displayed on March 6th, 2025, and is due on April 6th, 2025. Remember to answer all questions, and each question should be written in two to three pages. You are encouraged to make presentations.

**Question 1: Self-Reflection**

[00:00:20 to 00:01:00]

Visual: Show the text of Question 1. Use graphics or animations to represent "goals", "right and wrong", "achievements", and "shortcomings".

Audio:
Question 1 asks you to introduce yourself in detail, reflect on your life goals, and how you set them. This section also encourages you to analyze and explain your process of understanding right and wrong, and reflect on your salient achievements and shortcomings. This question is about introspection. Be honest and thoughtful in your responses.

**Question 2: Techno-Genie Maladies & Threats to Human Happiness**

[00:01:00 to 00:02:00]

Visual: Split screen. One side shows images of environmental pollution, global warming, etc. The other side shows images of nuclear proliferation, terrorism, etc.

Audio:
Question 2 is divided into two parts. Part A deals with problems caused by technology and human activities, such as pollution and resource depletion. What is the root cause, and what's the solution in your opinion? Part B shifts focus to threats to human happiness, like terrorism and broken relationships. Again, what are the root causes and potential solutions? Consider the big picture here.

**Question 3: Natural Acceptance & Basic Requirements for Fulfillment**

[00:02:00 to 00:02:45]

Visual: Graphics depicting the concept of "Natural Acceptance" (e.g., a person feeling content, accepting others). Then, graphics showing "Right Understanding", "Relationship", and "Physical Facilities".

Audio:
Question 3 explores "Natural Acceptance," the innate ability to accept yourself and the world. It asks you to consider what is naturally acceptable to you in relationships, and whether your living aligns with your natural acceptance. Part B focuses on the three basic requirements for fulfillment: right understanding, relationships, and physical facilities. Reflect on how problems in your family relate to these and how you dedicate time to each in your daily life.

**Question 4: Physical Facilities vs. Feelings**

[00:02:45 to 00:03:30]

Visual: A graphic showing the sequence of physical facility usage (necessary & tasteful to intolerable). Next to it, show the two categories of feelings (naturally acceptable or not acceptable).

Audio:
Question 4 asks you to compare your relationship with physical facilities and feelings. Note how physical facilities progress from necessary to intolerable. Conversely, feelings are either naturally acceptable or not acceptable at all. List your important activities and categorize them according to these frameworks.

**Question 5: Narration of Human Values & Willful Adherence to Values**

[00:03:30 to 00:04:15]

Visual: Images representing stories, poems, skits, or essays. Then, a graphic depicting a difficult situation where someone sticks to their values.

Audio:
Question 5 has two options. In Part A, write a story, poem, skit, or essay to clarify a Human Value to children. In Part B, narrate an incident in your life where you successfully exhibited willful adherence to values in a challenging situation.

**Question 6: Classifying Units of Nature & Mutual Fulfilment**

[00:04:15 to 00:05:00]

Visual: Show examples of each order of nature: Material, Plant/Bio, Animal, and Human.

Audio:
Question 6 involves listing common units of nature and classifying them into the four orders: Material, Plant/Bio, Animal, and Human. You also need to analyze the aspect of mutual fulfillment between these orders.

**Question 7: Societal Problems & Natural Acceptance**

[00:05:00 to 00:05:45]

Visual: Graphics representing current societal problems (e.g., poverty, inequality).

Audio:
Question 7 asks you to identify two important problems facing society, analyze their root causes, and consider if they can be solved based on the natural acceptance of human values. If so, how should we proceed from our current situation?

**Question 8: Science & Technology for a Universal Human Order**

[00:05:45 to 00:06:30]

Visual: Images representing science and technology being used in a positive way, contributing to a better society.
