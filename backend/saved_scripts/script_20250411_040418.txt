**Host:** Hey everyone, and welcome! We're here today to break down your upcoming Universal Human Values assignment. Don't worry, it might seem like a lot at first, but we'll walk through it together so you can ace it!

**(Transition to a screen showing the assignment details: Course Code, Name, Dates etc.)**

**Host:** Alright, first things first. Make sure you know the important dates: the display date is March 6th, 2025, and the submission date is April 6th, 2025. Don't miss that deadline! This is for the Even Semester of 2024-2025. Each question carries equal marks, so make sure you dedicate enough time to each one. And remember, aim for two to three pages per answer, and feel free to get creative with presentations!

**(Transition to a breakdown of the questions, one by one.)**

**Host:** Let's dive into the questions. Question one is all about YOU! It's asking you to introduce yourself in detail. Think about your life goals, how you set them, and how you decide what's right and wrong. Also, reflect on your achievements and shortcomings – be honest with yourself! This is a great opportunity for some self-reflection.

**(Slightly faster pace as the host summarizes the following questions.)**

**Host:** Okay, next up, Question 2. It’s in two parts. Part A focuses on techno-genie maladies – basically, problems caused by technology and human activities, like pollution and global warming. What's the root cause, and what's the solution? Part B looks at other threats to human happiness, like terrorism and depression. Again, what are the root causes, and how can we fix them?

**Host:** Question 3 is all about Natural Acceptance. This is the idea that we instinctively know what's right. Part A asks you to explore what's naturally acceptable to you in relationships – respect or disrespect? Nurturing or exploiting others? Are you living in line with your natural acceptance? Part B wants you to think about the three things we need to fulfill our aspirations: right understanding, relationships, and physical facilities. How do problems in your family relate to these, and how much time do you spend on each?

**Host:** Question 4 looks at how we use physical facilities. Think about how things go from necessary and tasteful, to unnecessary but tasteful, to unnecessary and tasteless, and finally, intolerable! Then compare that to your feelings - they are either acceptable or not acceptable. List your activities and categorize them based on this sequence.

**Host:** Question 5 is where you can get creative! Part A asks you to write a story, poem, skit, or essay to explain a human value to children. Part B wants you to share a real-life incident where you stuck to your values in a tough situation. Time to get storytelling!

**Host:** Question 6 is about nature! List common things you see every day and classify them into the four orders of nature: Material, Plant/Bio, Animal, and Human. Then, analyze how each order fulfills the others.

**Host:** Almost there! Question 7 asks you to identify two major problems facing society. Analyze the root causes. Can we solve them using natural human values? How would we even start?

**Host:** And finally, Question 8. This is your chance to shine! How can you use your knowledge of science and technology to help create a universal human order? Think big!

**(Transition back to the host, who is now smiling.)**

**Host:** So, that's it! I know it seems like a lot, but take it one question at a time. Remember to think critically, be honest with yourself, and most importantly, have fun with it! You got this!
