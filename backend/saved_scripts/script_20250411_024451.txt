**Visual:**  Slide depicting a single-line diagram as a prerequisite.

**Audio:** First let us start by Single Line Diagram as a prerequisite.

**Visual:** Slide: "Introduction to Power System"

**Audio:** Let's start with an introduction to the power system itself.  Think of the entire system as having three key parts: the **source**, where the electricity is generated; the **transfer** stage, which includes transmission and distribution; and the **load**, which is you, the consumer.

**Visual:** Slide: "Introduction to Power System" with objectives listed.

**Audio:**  The objectives of a good power system are pretty straightforward. We want to deliver electricity at a **rated voltage and frequency** to your homes and businesses. It needs to be **reliable**, so the power is always there when you need it. It has to be **flexible**, allowing for different voltage levels. We want **faster clearance of faults** so that it runs well for longer time and it life elongates, the **cost of power** must be as low as possible and The **losses in the system** must be as low as possible.

**Visual:** Slide: "Power System Components" with "Generation System," "Transmission System," and "Distribution System" listed.

**Audio:**  Now, let's look at the key components.  First, we have the **generation system**.  This is where electricity is produced, typically by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Generation voltage may be between 11 to 35 KV. Next is **transmission system**, the transmission system interconnects all the generating stations and major load centers in the system. Transmission voltage may be generally higher 220KV or upward. Finally, the **distribution system** represents the final stage of power transfer to the individual consumer at very low voltage level.

**Visual:**  Slide showing "THERMAL POWER PLANT"

**Audio:** Let's get into the first power generation method: the Thermal Power Plant.

**Visual:** Slide showing Introduction to Thermal Power Plant

**Audio:** Thermal power plants convert heat energy into electric power.  Most often, they use steam-driven turbines. Water is heated, becomes steam, and spins a turbine which, in turn, drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated. The major variations in thermal plants come from the different heat sources, like fossil fuels, nuclear heat, or solar heat. Certain thermal power plants also are designed to produce heat energy for industrial purposes of district heating, or desalination of water, in addition to generating electrical power.

**Visual:** Slide showing Factors for Selection of Site

**Audio:** Let's look at Factors for selection of site. Supply of fuel. The steam power plant should be located near the coal mines so that transportation cost of fuel is minimum. Availability of water. As huge amount of water is required for the condenser, therefore such a plant should be located at the bank of river or near a canal to ensure the continuous supply of water. Transportation facilities. A modern steam power plant often requires the transportation of material and machinery, adequate transportation facilities must exist that is the plant should be well connected to other parts of the country by rail or road.

**Visual:** Slide showing factors Cost and type of land, Nearness to the load center, Distance from populated area.

**Audio:** The steam power plant should be located at a place where land is cheap and further extension is possible if necessary. In order to reduce the transmission cost, the plant should be located near the centre of the load and this is particularly important if dc supply system is adopted. As huge amount of coal is burnt in a steam power station, therefore smoke and fumes pollute the surrounding area, so the plant should be located at a considerable distance from the populated areas .

**Visual:** Slide showing Main parts and working

**Audio:** Let us see the main parts and working. Steam is produced in the boiler, is expanded in the prime mover and is condensed in a condenser to be fed into boiler again. In practice, however a good number of modifications/improvements are affected so as to have heat economy and to increase the thermal efficiency of the station . The plant can be divided into four main circuits, namely
1. Fuel and ash circuit
2. Air and gas circuit
3. Feed water and steam circuit
4. Cooling water circuit

**Visual:** Slides showing diagram of thermal power plant with fuel and ash circuit, air and gas circuit, feed water and steam circuit, cooling water circuit.

**Audio:** First is fuel and ash circuit where Fuel from the storage is fed to the boiler through fuel feeding device commonly known as coal handling plant .Ash produced as a result of combustion of coal collects at the back of the boiler and is removed to ash storage through ash handling equipment.

**Visual:** Slides showing diagram of thermal power plant with fuel and ash circuit, air and gas circuit, feed water and steam circuit, cooling water circuit.

**Audio:** Next comes Air and gas circuit where Air from the atmosphere is supplied to the combustion chamber of the boiler through the action of a forced draught (F.D.) fan.The air before being supplied to the boiler passes through the pre heater where it is heated by the heated by the heat of flue gases which are then made to pass to the chimney .The flue gases first pass around the boiler tubes and super heater tubes in the furnace, next through the dust collector and then through the economizer .Finally they are exhausted to the atmosphere through the induced draught (I.D.) fan from air preheater.

**Visual:** Slides showing diagram of thermal power plant with fuel and ash circuit, air and gas circuit, feed water and steam circuit, cooling water circuit.

**Audio:** Finally we have Feed water and steam circuit where the condensate leaving the condenser is first heated in a closed feed water through extracted steam from the lowest pressure extraction point of the turbine .This water then passes through the deaerater and few more water heaters before it goes into the boiler through the economizer .A small part of the steam and water in passing through the different components of the system is lost. Therefore water is added in the feed water system as make up water .In the boiler drum and tubes, water circulates because of the difference in the density in the lower and higher temperature sections of the boiler .Wet steam from the drum is further heated in the superheater before it is supplied to the prime mover .

**Visual:** Slides showing diagram of thermal power plant with fuel and ash circuit, air and gas circuit, feed water and steam circuit, cooling water circuit.

**Audio:**
From the LP turbine it is exhausted through the condenser into the hot well.
The steam finally mixes with the feed water and is sent to the boiler drum.

**Visual:** Slides showing diagram of thermal power plant with fuel and ash circuit, air and gas circuit, feed water and steam circuit, cooling water circuit.

**Audio:** Then the Cooling water circuit which is required to condense the steam in the condenser and in maintaining a low pressure in it.Cooling water may be taken from the upper side of the river and after passing through the condenser it may be discharged to the lower side of the river .

classification  may be based  upon :

The fundamental working principle of a gas turbine power plant is same as that
of a steam turbine power plant . The only difference is there that in steam turbine power plant we use compressed steam to rotate the turbine, but in gas turbine power plant we use compressed air to turn the turbine.
