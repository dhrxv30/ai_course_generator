**Problem Statement (0:15-0:45)**

Narrator: Let's face it, traditional educational resources often fall short. Many students struggle with engagement, finding it difficult to focus and retain information. This leads to poor academic performance and a lack of interest in the subject matter. Add in the fact that every student learns differently and has varying attention spans, and it's clear that a one-size-fits-all approach just doesn't work. Current education resources often miss the importance of multidisciplinary approach, hindering a student's learning experience.
