**(Slide: General Instructions)**

Remember to answer ALL questions. All questions carry equal marks. Keep your answers concise, aiming for two to three pages per question. And great news - students are encouraged to make presentations!

**(Slide: Question 1)**

Okay, let's look at the first question. This one's about you! It asks you to introduce yourself in detail. Then, it asks about your life goals: How do you set them? How do you differentiate between right and wrong? Finally, reflect on your significant achievements and shortcomings. Take some time to really think about this one!

**(Slide: Question 2 A & B)**

Question 2 has two parts, A and B.

2A focuses on problems caused by technology and human activities – things like pollution, global warming, and resource depletion. The question asks: What's the root cause of these issues, and what's your proposed solution?

2B shifts to problems like nuclear proliferation, terrorism, broken relationships, and mental health challenges. Again, you need to identify the root cause and suggest a way forward.

**(Slide: Question 3 A & B)**

Question 3 also has two parts.

3A explores "Natural Acceptance" – that innate ability to know what's right for you. It asks you to consider what feels naturally acceptable in relationships (respect vs. disrespect) and in how you treat others (nurturing vs. exploiting). Are you living in line with your natural acceptance?

3B focuses on the three basic requirements for fulfilling your aspirations: right understanding, relationships, and physical facilities. How do problems in your family relate to these? And how much time and effort do you dedicate to each in your daily life?

**(Slide: Question 4)**

Question 4 looks at how we interact with physical facilities and our feelings. It asks you to observe how physical facilities can go from "necessary and tasteful" to "intolerable" over time. Feelings, on the other hand, are either acceptable or not acceptable. Think about your important activities and categorize them.

**(Slide: Question 5 A & B)**

Question 5 lets you get creative!

5A asks you to write a story, poem, skit, or essay to explain a Human Value to children.

5B asks you to share a personal story about a time you showed commitment to values in a tough situation.

**(Slide: Question 6)**

Question 6 dives into the four orders of nature: Material, Plant/Bio, Animal, and Human. List common examples from your daily life, classify them, and explain how they mutually fulfill each other.

**(Slide: Question 7)**

Question 7 asks you to identify two major societal problems and analyze their root causes. Can these problems be solved using human values and natural acceptance? How can we move forward from our current situation?

**(Slide: Question 8)**

Finally, Question 8 challenges you to think about how you can use your knowledge of science and technology to create a more universal human order. What innovative solutions can you come up with?

**(Conclusion - 5 seconds)**

That's it for the assignment overview! Remember to think critically, be reflective, and put your best effort into it. Good luck, and thanks for watching!
